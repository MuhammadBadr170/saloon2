    <h1>INTRODUCTION:</h1>
    <p>Thank you for visiting our website. This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) applies to the websites that post this
        Privacy Policy, including, without limitation, www.inkedshopnyc.com (each a “Site” and collectively, the
        “Sites”) (however accessed and/or used, whether via personal computers, mobile devices or otherwise), which are
        owned and operated by Diomond Heart Bespoke Tattoo Salon, (“Diomond Heart Bespoke” or “we,” “our,” or “us”).
        This Privacy Policy also applies to widgets, applications, interactive features, and/or downloads that are owned
        or operated by Diomond Heart Bespoke Tattoo Salon and available through the Sites, or that post a link to this
        Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy covers information collected at the Sites and does not cover any information
        collected at any other website or offline by Diomond Heart Bespoke Tattoo Salon (unless specifically stated).
        <br>

        At our Sites, we aim for you to have a pleasant experience. To achieve this, we collect information about you
        and your visits to the Sites. This includes details on the types of information we collect and how we use it.
        Our Privacy Policy clarifies these practices, so please take the time to read it carefully. Additionally, please
        review our Terms of Use, which governs your use of our Sites.
    </p>

    <h2>CONSENT:</h2>
    <P>BY USING THE SITES OR SUBMITTING PERSONAL INFORMATION THROUGH THE SITES, YOU EXPRESSLY CONSENT TO THE COLLECTION,
        USE, AND DISCLOSURE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION ACCORDING TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY.</P>
    <br>
    <br>

    <h2>Information You Provide To Us</h2>
    <p>We may ask that you provide us, or otherwise give you the opportunity to provide us, with certain categories of
        information, such as: (1) personally identifiable information (i.e., information that can reasonably be used to
        identify you personally, or information associated with the foregoing) such as your name, email address, birth
        date, credit card number, and physical address (any of the foregoing, “Personal Information”); and (2)
        demographic information, such as gender, zip code, or similar information (“Demographic Information”). We may
        collect this information through various forms and in various places on the Sites, including account
        registration forms if you maintain a “wish list,” sweepstakes and contest entry forms, email newsletter
        sign-ups, or when you submit information, communicate, or otherwise interact with us. We do not consider
        Demographic Information about you to be Personal Information unless it is associated with Personal Information
        so as to permit the identification of you. If we combine Demographic Information with the Personal Information
        we collect, we will treat it as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>INFORMATION WE COLLECT VIA TECHNOLOGY:</h2>
    <p>In addition to any Personal Information or other information that you choose to submit to the Sites, we and our
        third-party service providers may use a variety of now and l methods or technologies that automatically or
        passively collect certain information whenever you visit or interact with the Sites (“Usage Information”). This
        Usage Information may include the browser you are using, the URL that referred you to our Sites, all of the
        areas within our Sites that you visit, and the time of day, among other information. We may use Usage
        Information for a variety of purposes, including to enhance or otherwise improve the Sites and your interaction
        with them. In addition, we collect your IP address or other unique identifier (“Device Identifier”) for your
        computer or other devices used to access the Sites (any, “Device”). A Device Identifier is a number that is
        automatically assigned to your Device used to access the Sites, and our computers identify your Device by its
        Device Identifier. Whenever we associate Usage Information or a Device Identifier with your Personal
        Information, we will treat it as Personal Information.
        <br>

        A few of the methods and technologies that may be used to collect Usage Information include the following:
        Cookies. A cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Sites. A Flash cookie is a data
        file placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plugin that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device.
        Cookies and Flash Cookies may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation, remembering you and your
        preferences and tracking your visits to our web pages. If you choose to disable cookies or Flash cookies on your
        Device, some features of the Sites may not function properly.
        <br>

        Web Beacons. Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as “1×1 GIFs” or
        “clear GIFs”) may be included in our web pages and email messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any
        electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web page or email can act as a web beacon. Web
        beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count
        visitors to the Sites, to monitor how users navigate the Sites, to count how many emails that were sent were
        actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.
        <br>

        Embedded Scripts.An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your
        interactions with the Sites, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device
        from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Sites, and
        is deactivated or deleted thereafter.
    </p>



    <p>
    <h2>PURCHASES MADE THROUGH OUR SITES:</h2>
    <br>
    We may contract with third parties to provide services such as online order selection and fulfillment services for
    the products available on our Sites (“Products”). You acknowledge and agree that you may be leaving our Sites to
    select Products and place your Product order. Such third parties’ websites are subject to such sites’ policies, and
    when you are on those sites, those sites’ privacy policy and not this Privacy Policy govern the collection of
    information from you.
    <br>

    <h2>PERSONAL INFORMATION FROM OTHER SOURCES:</h2>
    We may from time to time supplement the information we collect about you online with information from other sources,
    such as information validating your address or information you provided to us through one of our retail stores,
    including, without limitation, in order to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to
    offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you. Thus,
    information we obtain may be intermingled with and used in conjunction with information obtained through other
    sources, including both offline and online sources. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to any
    Personal Information received, unless we have stated otherwise. <br>

    You may also choose to participate in a third party application (such as one of our Facebook applications or a
    similar application on a third party web site) through which you allow us to collect (or the third party to share)
    information about you, including Personal Information. The third party may allow you to remove the application, in
    which case we will no longer collect information about you through the application, but we may retain the
    information previously collected. In addition, we may receive information about you if other users of a third party
    web site give us access to their profiles and you are one of their “friends” or information about you is otherwise
    accessible through your friend’s web page, profile page, or similar page on a social networking or other third party
    web site or interactive service. <br>

    <h2>INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE ABOUT A THIRD PARTY:</h2>
    If you send someone else a communication from the Sites, such as sending an article to a friend or information about
    Products, we use the information you provide (typically, names and email addresses) to facilitate the communication
    and we do not use it for any other marketing purpose, unless we obtain consent from that person. <br>

    <h2>USE OF INFORMATION</h2>:
    Diomond Heart Bespoke Tattoo Salon may use your Personal Information, Demographic Information or Usage Information:
    (1) to provide you
    with products, information or services or process transactions that you have requested or agreed to receive,
    including to send you electronic newsletters, or to provide you with special offers or promotional materials on
    behalf of us or third parties; (2) to enable you to participate in a variety of the Sites’ features such as online
    entry sweepstakes, message boards and other communication features, user-generated content functions, and
    interactive features; (3) to process your registration with the Sites, including verifying your email address is
    active and valid; (4) to improve the Sites or our services, to customize your experience on the Sites, or to serve
    you specific content that is most relevant to you; (5) to contact you with regard to your use of the Sites and, in
    our discretion, changes to the Sites and/or Sites’ policies; (6) for internal business purposes; and (7) for
    purposes disclosed at the time you provide your information or as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy.
    <br>

    Further, we may use third party analytics and other service providers to evaluate and provide us with information
    about the use of the Sites and viewing of our content. We do not share Personal Information with these analytics
    service providers, but they may set and access their own tracking technologies and methods such as cookies, web
    beacons and embedded scripts on your Device and they may otherwise collect or have access to information about you,
    including Usage Information. This Privacy Policy does not govern such third party tracking technologies but does
    govern our collection and use of your Usage Information we receive in connection therewith. <br>

    Please note that when you submit information to the Sites via a “contact us” or other similar function, you may not
    always receive a response. We will not use the information provided to contact you for marketing purposes unrelated
    to your request unless you agree otherwise. <br>

    <h2>DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION:</h2>
    Diomond Heart Bespoke Tattoo Salon may share Usage Information and Demographic Information with third parties.
    Except as set forth in
    Section (f) below, we do not share your Personal Information with third parties for those third parties’ marketing
    purposes unless you consent to such sharing at the time you provide your Personal Information. Notwithstanding
    anything herein to the contrary, we may share the information we have collected about you, including Personal
    Information, as disclosed at the time you provide your information and as described below or otherwise in this
    Privacy Policy.
    <br>
    When You Agree To Receive Information From Third Parties. You may be presented with an opportunity to receive
    information and/or marketing offers directly from third parties. If you do agree (or, as applicable, do not decline)
    to have your Personal Information shared, your Personal Information will be disclosed to such third parties and all
    information you disclose will be subject to the privacy policy and practices of such third parties. We are not
    responsible for the privacy policies and practices of such third parties and, therefore, you should review the
    privacy policies and practices of such third parties prior to agreeing to receive such information from third
    parties. If you later decide that you no longer want to receive communication from a third party, you will need to
    contact that third party directly. <br>
    Third Parties Providing Services on Our Behalf. We may use third party vendors to perform certain services on behalf
    of the Sites, such as hosting the Sites, designing and/or operating the Sites’ features, tracking Site analytics,
    enabling you to purchase Products and enabling Diomond Heart Bespoke Tattoo Salon to send you email newsletters or
    performing other
    administrative services. We may provide these companies with access to user information, including Personal
    Information, to carry out the services they are performing for you or for Diomond Heart Bespoke Tattoo Salon.
    <br>
    Co-branded Areas. Certain areas of the Sites may be provided to you in association with third parties (“Co-Branded
    Areas”) and may require you to disclose Personal Information in order to register for and access Products. Such
    Co-Branded Areas will identify the third party associates. If you elect to register for Products and/or services at
    Co-Branded Areas you may be providing your information to both Diomond Heart Bespoke Tattoo Salon and the third
    party associates.
    Further, if you sign-in to a Co-Branded Area with a username and password obtained on the Sites, your Personal
    Information may be disclosed to the identified third party associates for that Co-Branded Area and will be subject
    to the posted privacy policies.
    Sweepstakes, Contests and Promotions. We may offer sweepstakes, contests, and other promotions (any, a “Promotion”)
    through the Sites that may require registration. By participating in a Promotion, you are agreeing to the terms,
    conditions and official rules that govern that Promotion, which may contain specific requirements of you, including,
    except where prohibited by law, allowing the sponsor(s) of the Promotion to use your name, voice and/or likeness in
    advertising or marketing associated with the Promotion. If you choose to enter a Promotion, Personal Information may
    be disclosed to third parties or the public in connection with the administration of such Promotion, including,
    without limitation, in connection with winner selection, prize fulfillment, and as required by law or permitted by
    the Promotion’s official rules, such as on a winners list. <br>
    Administrative and Legal Reasons. We may transfer and disclose your information, including Personal <h2>Information,
        to third parties:</h2>
    in the event we are required to respond to subpoenas or other legal process or if in our good faith opinion such
    disclosure is required by law;
    at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation;
    to protect and/or defend the Sites’ Terms of Use or other policies applicable to the Sites; or
    to protect the personal safety, rights, property or security of any individual.
    We may also use IP address or other Device Identifiers to identify users, and may do so in cooperation with
    copyright owners, internet service providers, wireless service providers or law enforcement agencies in our
    discretion. Such disclosures may be carried out without notice to you.
    <br>

    Business Transfer. Diomond Heart Bespoke Tattoo Salon may share Personal Information with its parent and its and
    their subsidiaries and
    affiliates. Diomond Heart Bespoke Tattoo Salon also reserves the right to disclose and transfer all information
    related to the Sites,

    subsequent owner, co-owner or operator of the Sites or applicable database; or (ii) in connection with a corporate
    merger, change of control, consolidation, restructuring, the sale of substantially all of Diomond Heart Bespoke

    other corporate change, including, without limitation, during the course of any due diligence process.
